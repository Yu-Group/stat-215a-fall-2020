### Collaboration and Integrity ###

Bin believes that academic integrity and honesty are imperative bedrocks for
learning and academic fulfillment. She will zoom-meet with every student to get
personal commitment to academic integrity and honesty from each student.
Students are encouraged to collaborate on hw and labs and it is required that
collaborative credits are clearly acknowledged in turned-in hw and lab reports
on the front page of a lab report.
